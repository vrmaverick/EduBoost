This all culiminated with the Weimar Republic being poor and with the Great Depression even poorer and didn't had a backbone to run the whole country . This sees the rise of a certain Austrian Painter named Adolf Hitler chan . \n\nHitler Chan was a soldier in the Great War and was a proud German , he was a staunch Cristian and had a very anti-semitic views . People saw the love for his nation in him and saw how he hated jews , nut neglected it . They saw him taking revenge by taking the land which were there . Hitler was the candidate of a certain Nationalist Socialist Party , NAZI in German , people sometimes forger the socialist aspect of it . He hated communists too yet he shook hands with Stalin and they both agreed to attack Poland on 2 nd September 1939 , Poland wasn't ready at that time to face the Blitz of the Germans from one side and the red terror from the other . The jews in Poland wouldnt have ever even joked that these was there end . \n\nHtiler gased juice , its called carbonated drink ",
